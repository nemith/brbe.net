      <description>The Go team just posted about The Next Step for Generics whiches shows the current progess for Generics in go which includes an updated draft which removed contracts completely and replaces them just with interfaces a long with a lot of different examples.
In addition the go team created a translation tool that will take the experimental generic code and convert it to concreate types via monophorphization so that you can play with and experiment with the feature.</description>
